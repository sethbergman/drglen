Take Regular Breaks\\n\\nLong periods of sitting down and looking at a computer monitor or pouring over paperwork can be taxing on the body and the mind. Even though you might be reluctant to take advantage of breaks due to your workload, it’s important that you do. Taking even short breaks can actually improve focus, boost energy and increase your overall productivity and sense of wellbeing.\\n\\n2. Bring Your Own Lunch to Work\\n\\nA good step towards greater wellness at work is to bring a healthy lunch with you and avoid eating out or being tempted by unhealthy office treats. When lunch hour rolls around, try to find a place other than your desk to eat such as an outdoor park or common area. Getting out of the office for a short period can provide some much needed relief and get your body moving.\\n\\n3. Take the Stairs\\n\\nIf you work in a multi-story office, skip the elevator and head for the stairs. Many studies indicate that humans who take at least 10,000 steps per day enjoy greater health. However, sitting at your desk all day can make that a tall order, so take advantage of those stairs to boost your heart rate and help strengthen the core and leg muscles.\\n\\n4. Create a \\\"Workout\\\" Work Space\\n\\nIf company policies allow for it, you can create a mini workout zone right in your office. Consider investing in a standing desk or a treadmill that can double as a work zone when you need to get some exercise and still be productive on company time.
